// Start off day with a reminder ping that Tournament is today. Charge headsets. Check Discord/Challonge names match. Remind them to switch back to Live if they were on Beta
// Brackets are made based off previous wins. So best players ranked from 1 - ?
// Flurry of last minute adds/drops is always irritating - easy button for them to leave/join?
// Brackets locked
// Threads created with Room number matching Match number, In Game Room number, and @ the players involved in match
// Biggest issue with threads, Discord and Challonge dont match.
// Before Tournament begins, tell them to quit out of game and relaunch so Comp button changes to Tournaments.
// Winners get reported, winner moves on and brackets are updated
// Round 3 or 4 we begin streaming, post that we go Live on Twitch in General and Tournament General
// Calculate top 8. post to Leaderboard
// It doesnâ€™t have to connect to challonge as long as brackets can get made
// And there can be a ranking of players based on wins'

// TODO Track tournament number
